In this assignment, you will write a user interface for your calculator. Your graphical user interface (GUI) should look like the screenshot below (creativity is good, but you also need to be able to design to customer specifications). When the user closes the window, the program should end. For this assignment the GUI does not need to respond to any other user input. Note that we are developing this GUI completely separately from any class. This is a common design pattern that is often called Model-View-Controller, or MVC. The model is the data your program deals with, the view is the user interface, and the controller responds to input from the view by acting on the data in the model. Developing programs in this way allows you to create different user interfaces (e.g. desktop, web-based, mobile phone) without modifying the rest of your program. Sample output:
